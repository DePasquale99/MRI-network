***Complex networks and Pattern recognition projects ***

Community analysis of a network extracted from structural MRI.
- reconstruction of functional BA from the structural communities (Networks)
- classification of the dataset into patients and control using network properties (Pattern)

The projects are based on the same dataset, gently prepared by dott. Nico Curti at Unibo, so I chose to put them togheter. The code is organized in the following way:

- In complex_networks.ipynb the main analysis pipeline of the community parcellations is performed. The code in corrected_graph.py is the one used to generate the weighted networks, for each of the 300 samples.
- In Pattern_recognition.ipynb i put the anaylisis of the graphomics dataset. in the file classification_preprocessing I instead transform the original database in something easily handlable by the classification models
